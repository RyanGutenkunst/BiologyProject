The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation has provided a grant to Dr. Michael Gottfredsen, University of Arizona Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education, to support a <A HREF = "team.html">design team</A> charged with developing the general structure and supportive materials needed to deliver student-oriented, highly interactive learning materials on the worldwide web. These learning materials are used to support the lecture, laboratory and discussion sessions of general education courses. 
</P>

<P>
Over the two-year period of the award, the design team will be responsible for:
</P>

<OL TYPE="1" START="1">
<LI>
Developing and implementing standardized instructional modules for a lower-division course in natural science and one in humanities/social science

<LI>
Using the modules to encourage and foster links between teaching and research faculty in order to provide the means to deliver cutting-edge research information to students

<LI>
Establishing links with other units on campus which support instructional development with an eye towards extending or customizing the course modules beyond the terms of the project

<LI>
Providing outreach services to faculty unfamiliar with the power of current advancements in instructional technology.
</OL>

Phase 1: The Biology Project
</B>
</FONT>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
The first phase of this two-year project uses the entry level biology course (<A HREF="http://www.blc.arizona.edu/courses/181gh/">Biology 181</A>) at the University of Arizona as a model for development and testing. Biology 181 is a general education course with a laboratory component and an enrollment of over 1,500 students every Fall.

Phase 2: The Architecture Project
</B>
</FONT>
<TABLE><TR>
          <TD> For the second phase, The Biology Project has chosen to team with 
            UA's Imagen, an online multimedia visual database, to develop materials 
            for Architecture & Society. Imagen is a rich resource of imagery in 
            the humanities that is already being used as a learning tool in Architecture 
            101. Architecture 101 is a general education course offered jointly 
            by Architecture and Humanities, with an enrollment of 150-180 students 
            every semester. The results of this collaboration can be found at 
            <A HREF="http://architecture.arizona.edu/courses/arc103/trad103/tutorials/default.html" target="_blank">The 
            Architecture Project</A>. </TD>

The Deliverable
</B>
</FONT>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
The deliverable from the project will be the courseware created by the design team.  Since courseware development will take place on a worldwide web site, there will be an ongoing record of the project's progress, and a continuing opportunity for evaluation and feedback. The project <A HREF="style_manual/index.html">style manual</A> is also available as a record of the web site's internal organization. So far, feedback from students and teachers who have visited the site has been <A HREF="kudos.html">very positive</A>.
