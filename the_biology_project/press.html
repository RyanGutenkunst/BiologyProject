Our son was diagnosed with color blindness today.  Researching on the
internet lead me to your site and your problem sets.  Thank you for the
easy to understand presentation of the genetic link and an explanation
of what he sees.  I am not a student, teacher or researcher, but just a
mom who is thankful to have found your site to help me understand. 
Thank you.

I teach high school biology and instruct at a
local community college in the summers. I have recently started to
incorporate internet activities into my courses. This summer I have
placed my General Biology syllabus on-line and have been searching for
activities to supplement the routine lectures and laboratory activities.
The activities in the "The Biology Project" will provide an invaluable
resource to help students succeed under the time constraints of a summer
session laboratory course. My web page, which links to the syllabus
page, can be found at http://www.users.nac.net/challoran/.

I just wanted to comment about your website.  It is extremely
informative and useful!  I work with a research team that deals with
plant physiology.  The question pools regarding photosynthesis are
extremely helpful! Keep up the great work!

This is a site well worth visiting - many times! You will want to assign it to your students, and you may even want to check it out for a quick review. And more than that - it is FUN and ENGAGING! Check out The Biology Project at the University of Arizona.

I have just had a good look at this excellent project.  As a fellow
biology teacher may I congratulate you on a most stimulating and
interesting way of teaching difficult ideas.  I am a biology teacher in
Devon, England teaching 16-18 year olds Advanced Biology.  The internet
is not readily available to all students at our school which is a pity
as the programme would be ideal for them.  Congratulations yet again.

Just wanted to let you know I found your site 
useful! I'm a science writer (at the NIH) putting together an educational booklet on chemistry and health. I found just what I was looking for on 
metals in biology on your site. Thanks!

I am a junior that attends Dauphin County Technical School in
Pennsylvania.  Currently in my English class we are holding a mock
trial, and I am a DNA expert in this trial.  I would just like to thank
you for the information from your pages, much of which will be useful to
me in the mock trial.

I just wanted to write to you and tell you how much I love your site.  I am a student at the University of Maryland, College Park, and I am taking Zoology 211.  I did a web search looking for glycolysis because I have an exam soon, and not only did I find the topic, but I found almost every topic that will be covered in my exam.  Also, your project allowed tutoring, which helped me with things that I was unsure of.  I also reffered your project to my class because I found it so helpful.  Thank You.

I have been examining your "Biology Project" website and I do
have to say it is awesome.  I teach AP biology in high school, and I
believe I will be having my students using your website a great deal.
Thanks for such a well-done job.  Keep the site going.  It provides me
with an innovative research and review tool while incorporating computer
and internet skills into my lessons.  There is a large push for this in
public education.  They just aren't providing the funding for it.  Once
again, Thanks!

Just found your site and I will share it with my colleagues. It is one
of the best, if not THE best, sites that I have found. Thank you for
putting it on the net. I am a high school science teacher in Garrett county, Maryland.
