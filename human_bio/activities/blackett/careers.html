What does a DNA analyst do?

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
DNA analysts prepare and analyze DNA from criminal evidence.  They interpret the results of their DNA analysis and often are required to testify as expert witnesses on their findings.  Because of the important nature of their work, analysts check each others findings (a process known as peer review).  They also follow strict quality control procedures to ensure accuracy within the laboratory.  
</P>
<P>
The field of DNA forensics is rapidly changing, requiring DNA analysts to stay current on all new techniques and procedures.  Regular attendance at seminars, lectures, and forensic functions is highly recommended.
