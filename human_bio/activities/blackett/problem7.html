Lanes 4-6 are unrelated individuals.  At times, bands in these lanes will match other individuals tested.  There is always a chance of having matched alleles for unrelated individuals.

For example, you determine that an unrelated individual has a match for a band with a Blackett family member.  If you were the DNA analysist for this probe on the left, what is one way to determine whether or not lane 4 is not related to lane 9?   Remember, the question above is asking for any "1-locus matches".  
<P>
The best way to answer paternity for this question is to determine if that same individual (lane 4) has the same band match with another 1-locus probe.  If the lane 4 continues to share bands with lane 9 on different one-locus probes, then these two individuals might be related.
