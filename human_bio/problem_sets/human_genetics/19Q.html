	I am wondering how to find out blood type of my grandson...my daughter is
A+..father is in question...she is stressed to the max on the father of
this baby boy.  

<P>
What is the most common blood type and the most common donor and common
 receiver?

	Blood type analysis can occasionally rule out a potential father (i.e. if the
 mother is type A and the child is type O, the father could not be type AB, but
 could be type A, B, or O), but is not a method that can be used to establish
 paternity.
</P>

If the paternity of your grandson needs to be established for legal reasons, such
 as establishing responsibility for child support, a <A HREF="../../activities/blackett/introduction.html">DNA test</A> would be the
 accepted method. There are
 commercial laboratories that will do the test for a fee (several hundred
 dollars). Blood samples would be required from the mother, child, and any
 alleged fathers.

Second Message from grandmother:

	Thanks so  much for your prompt reply.  Here is the scenario....paternity
isn't going to be established...it is going to lay...for lack of a better
expression.  My daughter is type A, my grandson is type B+, we do not know
the types of the two gentlemen in question...my question is what are the 
types that the fathers would have to be in order for him to be a B+?

<P>
What is the correct answer to the grandmother's question, "What are the 
types that the fathers would have to be in order for him (grandson) to be a B+?"
