<TT>We were surfing the net for
information on how to confirm blood types inherited from our parents. 
Your home page offered a lot of good, basic information, but since we
are non-bio-science types, our understanding is dated back to high
school.  Could you offer a reference that would be helpful to figure out
blood typing.  We understand that a ABO matrix is part of it, and we
expect it to be technically over our heads - but we're willing to try.
Our basic question is:  What is the blood type consistency of two parents
who are O+ who have 8 children?  2 of 8 are reported to be O+ and O-. 
Does that seem to be likely?? --John</TT>

	The parents are either O+/O+ or O+/O-. We really can't distinguish.
	
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
There are three possible crosses:

<P>
1. O+/O+ x O+/O-  ====> All children are O+
</P>

2. O+/O+ x O+/O+  ====> All children are O+

<P>
3. O+/O- x O+/O- ====> Children could be either O+ or O-
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

	It is very unlikely that the writer would be able to determine whether his
 parents are O+/O+ or O+/O-.  The best answer to this question would be that,
 given no additional information, the children could be either O+ or O-.
 
<P>
 This is a very interesting situation, since any of the eight children that were
 not type O would have a different biological father.
