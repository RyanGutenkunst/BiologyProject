They are not fully effective by themselves, but may help if used in addition to condoms. Condoms, used correctly and consistently, are effective in preventing the spread of most sexually transmitted diseases.  They are especially efficient in preventing the spread of the diseases transmitted by exchange of body fluids which takes place during vaginal, anal, or oral sex.<P>Condoms are also an efficient  barrier to the transmission of the diseases transmitted by direct contact if the infected area is covered by the condom.They are not efficient if the symptoms are located on the scrotum,  the buttocks, or the thighs.	</TD></TR></TABLE><P></P><FONT COLOR="#73 1A 54"><B>Spreading of STDs</B></FONT><TABLE><TR>	<TD>  Because the diseases are asymptomatic so much of the time, many people are infected and spreading STDs without knowing it. Clinical studies show that when a person is diagnosed with one STD there is 40% possibility that this person is also infected with a second STD.  There is also evidence that most STDs facilitate HIV transmission.	</TD></TR></TABLE><P><FONT COLOR="#73 1A 54"><B>Prevention</B></FONT><TABLE><TR>	<TD>		<BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE><TR>					<TD>	-	</TD>		<TD>	Abstinence is the best way to avoid sexually transmitted diseases.	</TD>	</TR>		<TR>					<TD>	-	</TD> 		<TD>	Sex with one partner "known" to be free of any STDs is also safer.	</TD></TR></TABLE>	</BLOCKQUOTE>Otherwise:	<BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE><TR>		<TD>	-	</TD> 	<TD>		Avoid having sex if you have doubts about the infectious status of your partner.	</TD></TR><TR>	<TD VALIGN=TOP>	-	</TD> 	<TD>	Ask  partner about past sexual partners and needle drug use.	</TD></TR><TR>		<TD VALIGN=TOP>	-	</TD> 		<TD>	Use condoms.
