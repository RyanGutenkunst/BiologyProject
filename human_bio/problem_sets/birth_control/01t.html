	The Pill, Norplant, and Depo-Provera injections work the same way.   They work by inhibiting ovulation, altering the uterine lining, and thickening the cervical mucus so sperm cannot penetrate it.  All three methods require prescriptions.  All three are very effective in preventing unintended pregnancies, but they offer no protection against sexually transmitted diseases.

	The Pill is a synthetic compound of the female hormones estrogen and progesterone.  There are many pill brands with varying hormone ratios and doses.  The MINI pill contains progesterone only. The Pill must be prescribed by a clinician and needs to be taken as prescribed.

<P>
The Pill, effective 97% to 99.5% of the time (fails 0.5% to 3% of the time), must be prescribed by a clinician and needs to be taken as prescribed.

Most brands of pills contain 28 in each packet.  The last 7 pills are a different color and are empty pills.  This is to allow a woman to get used to taking a pill every day.  Menstrual blood flow usually occurs between days 21 and 28 of the cycle.

  <P>
The Pill has the advantages of reducing menstrual cramps and flow.  It can also reduce risks for fibrocystic breast disease, as well as ovarian and endometrial cancer. Some women may experience a 3 - 5 lb weight gain, breast enlargement and emotional changes.

The Pill is not recommended for women with a history of blood clots, cancer, heart disease, migraine headaches, liver disease or smokers.
