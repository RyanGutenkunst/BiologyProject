It has a failure rate of 9% to 18% (effective rate of 82% to 91%) for women who have never had a child versus 26% to 36% (effective 64% to 74%) for women who have had a child.  It offers only minimal STD protection.	</TD></TR></TABLE><!--BUTTONS--><P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="05Q.html"><IMG SRC="../../buttons/problem_5_left.gif" BORDER=0></A> <A HREF="05a.html"><IMG SRC="../../buttons/answer.gif" BORDER=0></A> <A HREF="06Q.html"><IMG SRC="../../buttons/problem_6_right.gif" BORDER=0></A></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="birth_control.html"><IMG SRC="../../buttons/birth_control.gif" BORDER=0></A> <A HREF="../../human_bio.html"><IMG SRC="../../buttons/human_biology.gif" BORDER=0></A> <A HREF="../../../vocabulary/vocabulary.html"><IMG SRC="../../buttons/vocabulary.gif" BORDER=0></A> <A HREF="../../../default.html"><IMG SRC="../../buttons/the_biology_project.gif" BORDER=0></A></P><!--FOOTER--><HR><CENTER><FONT SIZE=2><A HREF="../../../the_biology_project/the_biology_project.html">The Biology Project</A><BR>University of Arizona<BR>Tuesday, February 10, 1998<BR><A HREF="http://biology.arizona.edu/contact">Contact the Development Team</A> <P>http://biology.arizona.edu<BR>All contents copyright &copy; 1998.
