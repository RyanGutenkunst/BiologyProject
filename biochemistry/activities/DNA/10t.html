The monomer units of DNA are nucleotides, and the polymer is known as a "polynucleotide." Each nucleotide consistsof a 5-carbon sugar (deoxyribose), a nitrogen containing base attached to the sugar, anda phosphate group. There are four different types of nucleotides found in DNA, differingonly in the nitrogenous base. The four nucleotides are given one letter abbreviations asshorthand for the four bases.<UL><LI>A is for adenine<LI>G is for guanine<LI>C is for cytosine<LI>T is for thymine</UL><H3><FONT COLOR="#AD 00 00">DNA Bases</FONT></H3><p> Adenine and guanine are purines. Purines are the larger of the two types of bases found in DNA. The 9 atoms that make up the fused rings (5 carbon, 4 nitrogen) are numbered 1-9. All ring atoms lie in the same plane. Cytosine and thymine are pyrimidines. The 6 atoms (4 carbon, 2 nitrogen) arenumbered 1-6. Like purines, all pyrimidine ring atoms lie in the same plane.<H3><FONT COLOR="#AD 00 00">Deoxyribose Sugar</FONT></H3><p> The deoxyribose sugar of the DNA backbone has 5 carbons and 3 oxygens. The carbonatoms are numbered 1', 2', 3', 4', and 5' to distinguish from the numbering of theatoms of the purine and pyrmidine rings. The hydroxyl groups on the 5'- and 3'- carbons link to thephosphate groups to form the DNA backbone. Deoxyribose lacks an hydroxyl group at the 2'-position when compared to ribose, the sugar component of RNA.<H3><FONT COLOR="#AD 00 00">Nucleosides and Nucleotides</FONT></H3><p> A nucleoside is one of the four DNA bases covalently attached to the C1' position of a sugar. The sugar in deoxynucleosides is 2'-deoxyribose. The sugar in ribonucleosides is ribose. Nucleosides differ from nucleotides in that they lack phosphate groups. The four different nucleosides of DNA are deoxyadenosine (dA), deoxyguanosine (dG), deoxycytosine (dC), and (deoxy)thymidine (dT, or T).In dA and dG, there is an "N-glycoside" bond between the sugar C1' and N9 of the purine.   A nucleotide is a nucleoside with one or more phosphate groups covalently attached to the 3'- and/or 5'-hydroxyl group(s).<H3><FONT COLOR="#AD 00 00">DNA Backbone</FONT></H3><p> The DNA backbone is a polymer with an alternating sugar-phosphate sequence. The deoxyribose sugars are joined at both the 3'-hydroxyl and 5'-hydroxyl groups to phosphate groups in ester links, also known as "phosphodiester" bonds.  <H3><FONT COLOR="#AD 00 00">DNA Double Helix</FONT></H3><p>  DNA is a normally double stranded macromolecule. Two polynucleotide chains, held together by weak thermodynamic forces, form a DNA molecule.<H3><FONT COLOR="#AD 00 00">Features of the DNA Double Helix</FONT></H3><UL TYPE=DISC>	<LI>Two DNA strands form a helical spiral, winding around a helix axis in a right-handed spiral.	<LI>The two polynucleotide chains run in opposite directions.	<LI>The sugar-phosphate backbones of the two DNA strands wind around the helix axis like the railing of a sprial staircase.	<LI>The bases of the individual nucleotides are on the inside of the helix, stacked on top of each other like the steps of a spiral staircase.</UL> <H3><FONT COLOR="#AD 00 00">Base Pairs</FONT></H3><P> Within the DNA double helix, A forms 2 hydrogen bonds with T on the opposite strand, and G forms 3 hyrdorgen bonds with C on the opposite strand. dA-dT and dG-dC base pairs are the same length, and occupy the same space within a DNA double helix. Therefore the DNA molecule has a uniform diameter. dA-dT and dG-dC base pairs can occur in any order within DNA molecules   <H3><FONT COLOR="#AD 00 00">DNA Helix Axis</FONT></H3><p> The helix axis is most apparent from a view directly down the axis. The sugar-phosphate backbone is on the outside of the helix where the polar phosphate groups (red and yellow atoms) can interact with the polar environment. The nitrogen (blue atoms) containing bases are inside, stacking perpendicular to the helix axis.<!--BUTTONS--><P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="10q.html"><IMG SRC="../../buttons/problem_10_left.gif" WIDTH="90" HEIGHT="30" BORDER="0"></A><A HREF="10a.html"><IMG SRC="../../buttons/answer.gif" WIDTH="90" HEIGHT="30" BORDER="0"></A></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="DNA.html"><IMG SRC="../../buttons/dna_structure_act.gif" WIDTH="90" HEIGHT="30" BORDER="0"></A><A HREF="../../biochemistry.html"><IMG SRC="../../buttons/biochemistry.gif" WIDTH="90" HEIGHT="30" BORDER="0"></A><A HREF="../../../vocabulary/vocabulary.html"><IMG SRC="../../buttons/vocabulary.gif" WIDTH="90" HEIGHT="30" BORDER="0"></A><A HREF="../../../default.html"><IMG SRC="../../buttons/the_biology_project.gif" WIDTH="90" HEIGHT="30" BORDER="0"></A></P><!--footer--><HR><CENTER><FONT SIZE=2><A HREF="http://biology.arizona.edu">The Biology Project</A><BR>University of Arizona<BR>Modified: May 27, 1997<BR><A HREF="http://biology.arizona.edu/contact">Contact the Development Team</A> <BR>http://biology.arizona.edu<BR>All contents copyright &copy; 1997.
