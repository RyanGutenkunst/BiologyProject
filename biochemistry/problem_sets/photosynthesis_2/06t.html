These reactions are catalyzed by a series of soluble enzymes, known collectively as "The Calvin-Benson Cycle". Carbohydrate biosynthesis can occur in the absence of photosynthetic electron transport. A summary of the events that occur during the dark reactions of photosynthesis is given by the summary equation:</TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER><!--use q17_equation1.pict--><P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="graphics/06t1.gif"></TD></TR></TABLE><FONT COLOR="#AD 00 00"><H4> Major components of this equation</H4></FONT><TABLE WIDTH=480><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>This overall equation can be broken down into three major components:</TD></TR></TABLE><BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>1.</TD><TD>Utilization of the NADPH produced during photosynthetic electron transport.

Carbohydrate biosynthesis from carbon dioxide is an endergonic process. It is coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP, a highly exergonic reaction.

Atmospheric carbon dioxide is converted to glucose during the Calvin-Benson cycle. This requires the overall reduction of CO<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>, using the electrons available from the oxidation of NADPH. Thus the dark reactions represent a redox pathway.
