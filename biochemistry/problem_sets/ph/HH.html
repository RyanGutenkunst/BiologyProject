<h2 align="center">Henderson-Hasselbalch equation</h2>
<p>Consider the ionization of a weak acid HA which has some pK<sub>a</sub>. It is often
  convenient to
  be able to relate the pH of a solution of a weak acid to the pK<sub>a</sub> of the acid
  and the extent
  of ionization. The reaction would be  </p>
<p align="center">HA (reversible arrows) H<sup>+</sup> + A<sup>-</sup></p>
<p>The
  acid dissociation constant (K<sub>a</sub>) for this reaction would be given by the equation </p>
<p align="center"><img src="graphics/HHa.gif" width="120" height="66"></p>
<p>This equation can be rearranged to isolate the hydrogen ion concentration
  on the left,
  because, remember, we want an equation relating the pH of the solution to the
  pK<sub>a</sub> and
  the extent of ionization of the weak acid. The rearranged form of the equation
  is </p>
<p align="center"><img src="graphics/HHb.gif" width="169" height="78"> </p>
<p>By definition, log 1<b><font size="+1">/</font></b>  [<i>H</i><sup>+</sup>] = <i>pH</i>  , and

  log 1<font size="+1"><b>/</b></font><i>K</i><sub>a</sub>  = <i>pK</i><sub>a</sub> , so that by taking the log of the equation
  above, we get the equation</p>

<p>This is the well-known Henderson-Hasselbalch equation that is often used to
  perform the
  calculations required in preparation of buffers for use in the laboratory,
  or other
  applications. Notice several interesting facts about this equation. </p>
<p>First,
  if the pH = pK<sub>a</sub>,
  the log of the ratio of dissociate acid and associated acid will be zero, so
  the
  concentrations of the two species will be the same. In other words, when the
  pH equals
  the pK<sub>a</sub>, the acid will be half dissociated. </p>
<p>Second, notice that
  as the pH increases or
  decreases by one unit relative to the pK<sub>a</sub>, the ratio of the dissociate
  form to the associated
  form of the acid changes by factors of 10. That is, if the pH of a solution
  is 6 and the pK<sub>a</sub>  is 7, the ratio of 
  [ A-]<b><font size="+1">/</font></b>[ HA]
 will be 0.1, will if the pH were 5, the ratio would be 0.01 and if
 the pH were 7, the ratio would be 1. </p>
<p>Also, note that if the pH is below the
  pK<sub>a</sub>, the ratio
 will be &lt; 1, while if the pH is above the pK<sub>a</sub>, the ratio will be &gt;1. In
  short, there is a lot of
  information in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. You would be wise to study
  this
  equation to understand its various ramifications.</p>
