Water has a simple molecular structure. It is composed of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms. 
Each hydrogen atom is covalently bonded to the oxygen via a shared pair of electrons. 
Oxygen also has two unshared pairs of electrons. Thus there are 4 pairs of electrons surrounding 
the oxygen atom, two pairs involved in covalent bonds with hydrogen, and two unshared pairs on 
the opposite side of the oxygen atom. Oxygen is an "electronegative" or electron "loving" atom compared with hydrogen.
            <P> Water is a "polar" molecule, meaning that there is an uneven distribution 
              of electron density. Water has a partial negative charge (<IMG SRC="graphics/-.gif" alt="Delta-">) 
              near the oxygen atom due the unshared pairs of electrons, and partial 
              positive charges (<IMG SRC="http://biology.arizona.edu/biochemistry/tutorials/chemistry/graphics/+.gif" alt="Delta-">) near 
              the hydrogen atoms. 
            <P>
An electrostatic attraction between the partial positive charge near the hydrogen atoms and the 
partial negative  charge near the oxygen results in the formation of a hydrogen bond as shown in 
the illustration.

The ability of ions and other molecules to dissolve in water is due to polarity. For example, 
in the illustration below sodium chloride is shown in its crystalline form and dissolved in water.

<P>
Many other unique properties of water are due to the hydrogen bonds.  For example, ice floats 
because hydrogen bonds hold water molecules
further apart in a solid than in a liquid, where there is one less hydrogen bond per molecule.  
The unique physical properties, including a high heat of vaporization, strong surface tension, high specific heat, and nearly universal solvent properties of water
are also due to hydrogen bonding.  The hydrophobic effect, or the exclusion of compounds containing
carbon and hydrogen (nonpolar compounds) is another unique property of water caused by the hydrogen bonds.  The hydrophobic effect is particularly
important in the formation of cell membranes.  The best description is to say that water "squeezes" nonpolar molecules together.

We define the pH of a solution as the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration. 

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>at pH 7.0, a solution is neutral 
	<LI>at lower pH (1-6), a solution is acidic
	<LI>at higher pH (8-14), a solution is basic
</UL>
