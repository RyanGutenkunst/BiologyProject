Two men were arrested in Nevada on the 19th of February 1998 on the assumption that they were in possession of large quantities of <I>Bacillus anthracis</I>. They actually possessed the harmless anthrax vaccine. What does the vaccine consist of?

	<I>B. anthracis</I> without capsule
	
<BLOCKQUOTE>	The antiphagocytic capsule is very important in the progression of anthrax since it protects the bacterium from being eliminated by cells of the immune system. Therefore, without the capsule <I>B. anthracis</I> can only multiply inside the body for a short time before the organism is eliminated by phagocytes. This allows the immune system to respond to the bacterium and form antibodies. If the vaccinated person is then infected with <I>B. anthracis</I> with capsule it can neutralize the toxins produced with the help of these antibodies.<BR>
<P>
This vaccine was first developed by Louis Pasteur for the vaccination of domestic animals such as cattle and sheep.</FONT>
