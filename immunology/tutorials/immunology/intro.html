                  <p>The Chinese are credited with making the observation that 
                    deliberately infecting people with mild forms of smallpox 
                    could prevent infection with more deadly forms and provide 
                    life long protection. Knowledge of the technique, known as 
                    variolation, worked its way west to Turkey by the 18th century. 
                  </p>
                  <p> Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, the wife of the British Ambassador 
                    to Turkey and who had once survived smallpox, had her children 
                    treated and brought the ideas back to Britain, where research 
                    began on how to reduce the inoculation's sometimes-awful side 
                    effects. </p>
                  <p>In 1798, the British physician Edward Jenner published his 
                    long-term observation that cowpox exposure protected milkmaids 
                    from smallpox. To see if this protection could be artificially 
                    induced, he exposed a "healthy boy" to cowpox virus from a 
                    milkmaid, and then attempted to infect the boy with smallpox. 
                    (Obviously, this experimental method is unethical by today's 
                    standards.) This method works because cowpox shares antigens 
                    with smallpox, but doesn't cause the disease.
