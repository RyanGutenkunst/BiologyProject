            <P>Monoclonal antibodies come from clones of B cells that produce 
              a single antibody of known specificity. B cells will nor normally 
              divide in the absence of antibody. The special trick that allowed 
              monoclonal antibody-producing cells to be grown in culture was:</P>

            <P>Within the body B cells are signalled to divide only after they 
              bind antigen. Additionally, B cells will not normally grow in culture. 
              In the mid 1970's, scientists discovered a method for producing 
              unlimited amounts of a single antibody. </P>

                <TD> Mice are immunized with an antigen, and B cells isolated 
                  from the blood. These cells are fused with cancer cells which 
                  grow continuously. Hybrid cells produce the antibody of the 
                  B cell, but can now grow in culture. The cells can be cloned 
                  or grown from single colonies and screened for specific antibody. 
                  Antibodies produced from these "hybridomas" are very useful 
                  in biology and medicine. </TD>
