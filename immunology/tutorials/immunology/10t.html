                  <P>The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a series of 
                    genes that code for cell surface proteins which control the 
                    adaptive immune response. The system is called H2 in mice 
                    and HLA (human lymphocyte antigen) in humans. Class I MHC 
                    contains three genes called HLA-A, B, and C; proteins from 
                    these genes are expressed on almost all cells. Class II MHC 
                    genes are called HLA-DR, DQ, and DP; their proteins are expressed 
                    on antigen-presenting macrophages, dendritic cells and B cells.</P>
                  <P> The function of these proteins is to present fragments of antigens to T cells. 
                    The receptor of T cells can only recognize antigen fragments 
                    in complex with MHC proteins.

                <TD> 
                  <P>Following phagocytosis of a pathogen, fragments of the pathogen 
                    are complexed with MHC proteins and displayed on the surface 
                    of the macrophage or dendritic cells of the innate immune 
                    system. If the cell encounters a dangerous pathogen, a co-receptor 
                    called B7 is produced. This is a crucial step for turning 
                    on the adaptive immune response and developing a memory of 
                    pathogen threats. Those helper T cells with a receptor that 
                    recognized the antigen fragment of the MHC complex can be 
                    stimulated to proliferate and be activated if the co-receptor 
                    is also displayed.</P>
                  <p>The dendritic cell of the innate system is used to initiate 
                    adaptive immunity.</p>

<TD COLSPAN="2">Following activation by an antigen presenting cell, the Helper 
T cell signals B cells and cytotoxic T cells to launch an immune response. This 
activation of helper T cells occurs in the lymph nodes. Following activation is 
another clonal selection, and helper T cells with the correct receptor are activated 
and proliferate.</TD>

peptides inside the cell and carry them to the cell surface. This is the form 
recognized by the T cell receptor on cytotoxic T cells. Class II have similar 
structures, but are specific for presenting antigen fragment to helper T cells.</P>
