<P><B>Tutorial to help you answer the question:</B></P>
<P>Human HLA genes (equivalent to MHC genes in mice) have many alleles, and no 
two individuals have identical alleles at all gene loci. Which of the following 
are consequences of this genetic diversity?</P>

                  <P>There is reasonable evidence that genetic pressures help 
                    to insure that offspring are different in the HLA loci from 
                    the parents. The high variability of HLA molecules enlarges 
                    the kinds of pathogens that can be recognized and eliminated 
                    by an immune response within a population. </P>
                  <P>However, a disadvantage of high HLA specificity occurs during 
                    organ transplants. The body recognizes the organ as non-self, 
                    and launches an immune response against it. Proteins from 
                    HLA genes are the cause of transplant rejections, and HLA 
                    genotypes must be partially matched to improve outcomes of 
                    organ transplants. </P>                  
                  <P> Finally, studies on many species show that mating preference 
                    and odor is somehow related to MHC alleles. Female mice prefer 
                    to mate with males having different MHC loci. The immune advantage 
                    of MHC diversity is apparently selected for during mating.</P>
