                  <P>Clonal selection theory illustrates how immunological memory 
                    permits a rapid response upon a second exposure to an antigen. 
                    Immunological memory is the basis of natural immunity and 
                    artificial immunity (from vaccinations). </P>
                  <p align="LEFT">Each B cell has a specific antibody as a cell 
                    surface receptor. The arrangement and generation of antibody 
                    genes occurs prior to any exposure to antigen. When a soluble 
                    antigen is present, it binds to the antibody on the surface 
                    of B cells that have the correct specificity. These B cell 
                    clones develop into antibody-producing plasma cells or memory 
                    cells. Only B cells, which are antigen-specific, are capable 
                    of secreting antibodies. </p>

                  <P>Following initial exposure to antigen, the plasma cells stop 
                    producing antibody and die. Memory cells remain in greater 
                    numbers than the initial B cells, allowing the body to quickly 
                    respond to a second exposure of that antigen. </P>

                <TD> The body can make low levels of soluble antibody about one 
                  week after exposure to antigen. However, a second exposure to 
                  antigen produces a much faster response, and several orders 
                  of magnitude higher levels of antibody. The ability of antibody 
                  to bind antigen also increases in the secondary response. The 
                  memory of antigen and stimulated response is the basis for vaccination.</TD>

                <TD>A secondary immune response (second exposure to an antigen) 
                  is not only faster but produces antibody with up to a 10,000 
                  fold increase in binding affinity. This higher affinity comes 
                  from a mechanism that alters the variable regions of light and 
                  heavy chains of the memory cells by specific somatic mutation. 
                  This is a random process that by chance can improve antigen 
                  binding. </TD>

                <TD>The system makes a mutation for each two cell divisions. Re-exposure 
                  to antigen is most likely to cause clonal expansion of memory 
                  cells which produce the highest affinity antibody. The mutations 
                  which lead to increased affinity will be clonally selected by 
                  antigen similarly to the primary response. Cells with inactive 
                  antibody will die by apoptosis from a lack of T cell signaling.</TD>
