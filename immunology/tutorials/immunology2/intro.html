<P>The Chinese are credited with making the observation 
                    that deliberately infecting people with mild forms of smallpox 
                    could prevent infection with more deadly forms and provide 
                    life long protection. Knowledge of the technique, known as 
                    variolation, worked its way west to Turkey by the 18th century.

<P>
Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, the wife of the British Ambassador to Turkey and who had once survived 
smallpox,
had her children treated and brought the ideas
back to Britain, where research began on how to reduce the inoculation's sometimes-awful side effects.
</P>

In 1798, the British physician Edward Jenner published 
                his long-term observation that cowpox exposure protected milkmaids 
                from smallpox. To see if this protection could be artificially 
                induced, he exposed a "healthy boy" to cowpox virus from a milkmaid, 
                and then attempted to infect the boy with smallpox. (Obviously, 
                this experimental method is unethical by today's standards.) This 
                method works because cowpox shares antigens with smallpox, but 
                doesn't cause the disease.

<P>Fortunately, the vaccine worked. 
                  The boy had developed an immunity to smallpox from his exposure 
                  to cowpox. The technique of vaccination against smallpox quickly 
                  spread through the world. In 1980, the World Health Assembly 
                  officially declared "the world and its peoples" free from endemic 
                  smallpox. The <A HREF="http://www.immunize.org">Immunization 
                  Action Coalition</A> is an excellent source of information about 
                  childhood, adolescent and adult immunizations and hepatitis 
                  B educational materials.

<P> In some cases, the immune system does mount an immune response against self. 
If an error is made, and an immune response is made against self, tolerance to

from pathogens. The mouse to the right has a transplant of rabbit skin, and can't 
reject the foreign tissue. Mice with immune deficiencies are very useful in cancer 
research because human cancer cells can grow into tumors allowing new ways to 
test cancer therapy. </TD>
