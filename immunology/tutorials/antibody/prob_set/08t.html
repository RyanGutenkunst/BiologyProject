<P> <!-- QUESTION -->The crystal structure of the Fab complexed to antigen reveals 
a number of water molecules that are fixed in the binding area. Many of these 
water molecules form hydrogen bond bridges between antigen and antibody, contributing 
to the strength of binding. There is no evidence for the exclusion of water from 
the antibody/antigen complex. The affinity for binding can be expressed by the 
equation describing free energy in a system: &Delta;G 
=<FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#000000" FACE="symbol"> </FONT>&Delta;H 
- T&Delta;S, where G = free energy 
or energy available for work, H = total energy in a system (enthalpy), T = absolute 
temperature (in Kelvin) and S = entropy. Which of the following statements are 
correct concerning the generation of a negative &Delta;G 
(indicating a spontaneous reaction) for high affinity antibody/antigen binding?

<TD VALIGN="TOP">Water molecules (light blue) fill in spaces between the antigen 
and the antibody. The water molecules contribute significantly to the binding 
energy by creating additional hydrogen bonds. Thus, hydrophobic attraction likely 
plays little role in the affinity, since a number of water molecules are inside 
the structural complex.</TD>

<P>Equation for free energy change: &Delta;G 
=<FONT SIZE="4" 
COLOR="#000000" FACE="symbol"> &Delta;</FONT>H 
- T&Delta;S </P>
<P>In this equation, &Delta;G is 
the change in free energy. &Delta;H 
is the change in total energy or enthalpy. The T&Delta;S 
term is the temperature multiplied by the entropy or disorder of the system. The 
more negative the term &Delta;G 
(indicating the release of free energy), the more favorable the reaction. </P>
<P>When the antibody and antigen interact, there is a reduced entropy due to loss 
of molecular freedom of motion. The presence of water molecules as part of the 
antigen/antibody structure also reduces entropy (decreasing T&Delta;S). 
Normally reduced entropy is associated with non-spontaneous reactions. However, 
hydrogen bonds formed between the antigen and antibody, and involving water molecules 
as hydrogen bond bridges releases energy and reduces the total energy of the system 
(decreases &Delta;H). The formation 
of van der Waals interactions also releases energy. Thus, &Delta;H 
is very negative, which leads to a negative &Delta;G. 
A negative &Delta;G indicates 
a spontaneous reaction. </P>
