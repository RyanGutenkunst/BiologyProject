            <p>The following is a true story, with names changed. Bridgett met 
              Albert when she was 17 and he was 24. He was very clean and good-looking, 
              and when they became sexually active he refused the use of condoms, 
              saying that he knew he was HIV free. After living together for a 
              year, they went to donate blood and were informed that the test 
              showed that both of them were HIV positive. Later, Albert's brother 
              told Bridgett that Albert had known that he carried HIV for two 
              years before she met him, and that he had previously infected another 
              young woman. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Should Albert be punished in any way for his actions since he 
                knew he was HIV positive? </li>
              <li>Should Albert be quarantined? Should his other known sexual 
                partners be informed? </li>
              <li>Should Bridgett be quarantined? What about her possible future 
                sexual partners?</li>
              <li>If Albert had not known in advance that he was HIV positive 
                but did live a high risk lifestyle would he still be held liable 
                for infecting Bridgett with HIV? </li>

            <p>A physician in Tucson had a young couple as patients who were experiencing 
              marital problems. The wife left for another man and the couple divorced. 
              This new man was HIV+, and the woman also became infected. After 
              his death, she returned to Tucson and her physician began treating 
              her for HIV infection. Her ex-husband came to the same physician 
              for a physical and mentioned that he had begun dating his ex-wife 
              again. The physician was unable to warn the man that his ex-wife 
              was now HIV+ since they were not married and any communication about 
              the woman would have violated right-to-privacy laws. What do you 
              think the physician should have done?</p>

            <p>In 1986, Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni has spearheaded an 
              aggressive anti-AIDS policy. Every government department issues 
              anti-AIDS warnings; sex is discussed openly in explicit terms; roadside 
              billboards promote safe sex; and foreign-financed non-government 
              organizations are given virtually free reign to educate people about 
              the disease. Since 1992, the level of infection among young pregnant 
              women has been in decline (Nature Medicine. 5, 963. 1999). Compared 
              to Uganda, do you think our society does an adequate job of educating 
              its citizens about HIV and AIDS? If not, what improvements do you 
              think are needed?</p>

              will this influence your behavior? The ELISA that you received detects 
              the presence or absence of antibodies against HIV. Antibodies can 
              take one to six months to develop after exposure to HIV. During 
              this time between exposure and antibody production the virus can 
              reproduce rapidly and the amount of virus present in body fluids 
              is high. How does this information influence your behavior?</p>

              and do not have access to anti-HIV medications. Drug companies spend

              that money, making it difficult for them to provide the drugs at

                drugs to treat HIV.

              and maintain a higher quality of life. Current anti-HIV drugs must 
              be taken multiple times daily on a careful schedule and often cause 
              severe side effects in people who otherwise may feel completely 
              healthy. If patients don't adhere to their drug regimens, they increase 
              the rate at which drug resistant strains of HIV develop. Should 
              patients be monitored for adherence to drug regimens and/or whether

              be made to help pay their costs? What if some HIV patients continue 
              high-risk behavior that exposes them to more infectious agents,

              of HIV through a population, why might we want to identify the original 
              HIV carriers? In the online exercise, fluid exchange with an HIV+ 
              individual automatically infects the other partner, although in 
              real life this is not necessarily true. Different behaviors carry 
              varying risks of HIV transmission. How might knowledge of rates
