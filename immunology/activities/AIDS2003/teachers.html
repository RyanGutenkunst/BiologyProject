            <P>This Web lab works well with a group of students within a classroom. 
              After you have read the <a href="directions.html">directions</a> 
              and tried the Web lab yourself, please consider the following suggestions 
              for using this activity within your class:</P>
            <P>Before beginning the activity, give each student an index card 
              with 3 small sticky notes with their name. After the computer generates 
              the random exchanges, have students trade sticky notes. For example, 
              students first trade sticky notes with their partners listed in 
              exchange 1. Then students trade sticky notes with partners in exchange 
              2 and so on. After 3 exchanges each student will have an index card 
              with the names of their three partners. This simple act of exchanging 
              names actively involves students in the simulation and allows them 
              to make a real connection with their virtual partners.</P>
            <P>For the epidemiology portion of the activity, encourage students 
              to work in small groups (4-6 students) to determine if anyone within 
              their group could have been an initial HIV carrier. Have the small 
              groups work through the <a href="questions.html">discussion questions</a>, 
              then compare the responses from each group. For example, the question 
              about punishing a man that knowingly exposed his girlfriend to HIV 
              often elicits a variety of responses among groups. In turn these 
              responses foster interesting and lively class discussions. </P>
