<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Problem 3: A fly cross involving two X-linked traits</H3>
</FONT>
What offspring would you expect from a cross between the female Drosophila described in problem 1 (red eyes and a yellow body, homozygous recessive for the yellow body color allele and homozygous dominant for the eye color allele) and the male described in problem 2 (hemizygous for both the recessive (white) eye color allele and dominant (tan) body color allele?)<P>


A reminder that the alleles for eye color and for body color are on the <B>X</B> chromosome of Drosophila, but not on the <B>Y</B>. Red eye color (w+) is dominant to white eye color (w), and tan body color (y+) is dominant to yellow body color (y). 

<!--If we mated the F1 female and male flies from this cross, what male phenotype in the F2 generation would be evidence that crossing over had occured during gamete formation?-->
