      </FONT> <!--CONTENT-GOES HERE.--> Mice were used in this experiment. Two groups 
      of mice were studied, the experimental group, which was exposed to ETS, 
      and the control group, which was not exposed to ETS. In the experimental 
      group, pregnant female mice were exposed to ETS for one hour per day, 5 
      days per week until the birth of the pups. After birth the pups were exposed 
      to ETS for 1 hour per day, 5 days per week for 3 weeks. In the control group, 
      neither the pregnant female mice nor their pups were exposed to ETS.
